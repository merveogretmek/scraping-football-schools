# Scraping Instrument Website

This repository contains a single Python script, scraping_script.py, that scrapes module data from an online instrument marketplace (ModularGrid). The script collects information about both currently available and discontinued modules, then outputs a combined CSV file (product_df.csv) with the collected data.
