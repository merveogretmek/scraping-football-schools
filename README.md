# Scraping Football Schools

This repository contains a single Python script (`scraping_script.py`) that scrapes football school data from \url{schoolsfootball.co.uk}. The script cycles through paginated search results, gathering school names, addresses, and location details. Finally, it writes the collected information to a CSV file, schools_data.csv.
